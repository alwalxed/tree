# Getting Started with Next.js Static Sites

Next.js is a powerful framework for building static sites that are fast, SEO-friendly, and developer-friendly. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a documentation site using Next.js.

## Why Choose Next.js for Documentation?

Static site generation with Next.js offers several advantages:

- **Performance**: Pre-rendered HTML loads incredibly fast
- **SEO**: Search engines can easily index your content
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, file-system routing, and more
- **Scalability**: Static sites can handle massive traffic with minimal resources

## Installation and Setup

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-docs-site
cd my-docs-site
```
